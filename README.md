### Overview

Disgo (*dispatch* + *go*) is the first client implementation of the Dispatch protocol. Dispatch enables the Zero-Knowledge Analytics of distributed data without comprimising data ownership, privacy, or security.

### Come talk with us!
If you have any questions or just want to get to know us better, come say hi in our [discord channel](https://Dispatchlabs.io/discord) (https://Dispatchlabs.io/discord)

### Download

With Go installed, enter either of the following commands into your terminal:

### How to run a Disgo node

Disgo is a full dispatch node, and you can run it right out of the box. Simply run the following commands in your terminal:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/dispatchlabs/disgo
go get ./...
go run main.go
```

### Using the protocol (Dancing the Disgo ðŸ•º)
- Non-technical users of the protocol can use [the network scanner](http://scanner.dispatchlabs.io) to interact with the protocol. 

- Developers "dance the disgo" with our decentralized [HTTP API](https://api.dispatchlabs.io), [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/dispatchlabs/dev-tools), or [Java SDK](https://github.com/dispatchlabs/java-sdk). 

### Configuration
The disgo package relies on the configuration loaded by [commons](https://github.com/dispatchlabs/disgo/tree/master/commons)
